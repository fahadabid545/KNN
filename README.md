# 🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch and using `scikit-learn` for classification tasks. The project covers the entire ML pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Implementing KNN using `scikit-learn`
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualizing decision boundaries (for 2D datasets)

## 📁 Files Included

- `knn_classifier.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete code and output
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
